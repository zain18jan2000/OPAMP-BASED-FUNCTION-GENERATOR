# OPAMP-BASED-FUNCTION-GENERATOR

<p>This Function Generator is capable of generating three types of signals which are as follow,</p><br><br>
1- Square Wave <br>
2- Triangular Wave <br>
3- Sine wave <br>
<br>
<p>On the basis of simulation results it is obsereved that the function generator can generate signal in the frequency range of 3kHz to 16 KHz. Hence the bandwith of function generator is 13 kHz. </p>
